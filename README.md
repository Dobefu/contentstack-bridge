# Contentstack Bridge

Adds a layer between your application and Contentstack, to provide some much-needed conveniences.

## Building

To build the application, simply run
``` bash
go build
```

This will create a new file, called `csb`. Running it now will throw an error,
since there is no configuration yet.
